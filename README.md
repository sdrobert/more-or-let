Feature experiments with an end-to-end convolutional phone recognizer

## What is it?
A somewhat over-engineered Kaldi recipe for end-to-end phoneme recognition on
TIMIT. The model is based on that of Zhang et al. [1], with a few minor
modifications. The recipe tests a variety of time-frequency features in
using Kaldi's built-in features as well as some provided by
_pydrobert-speech_ [2].

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository into _kaldi/egs/timit/_.
2. Softlink the _steps_ and _utils_ folders from _../../wsj/s5_ into this
   directory.
3. Take a look at _run.sh_ and _cmd.sh_, modifying them as you see fit.
4. Call `./run.sh`
Run steps 1-5 involve setting up the python environment, including things like
installing tensorflow from source. I tend to just do this manually and skip to
step 6.
